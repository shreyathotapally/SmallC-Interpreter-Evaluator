Project 4A: SmallC Parser
Due: Monday, July 13, (Late July 14) at 11:59:59 PM

Points: 48P/52SP/0S

Introduction
In this project, you will implement as Ocaml functions a lexer and parser for SmallC. Your lexer functions will convert a SmallC program internally stored as string into a list of tokens, and your parser functions will consume these tokens to produce an abstract symbol tree (AST). The input could be an entire program, or a fragment of a program, and your parser will produce an AST that represents one or more statements (stmt) or an expression (expr). This readme describes the tokens and grammar you will use.

The only requirement for error handling is that input that cannot be lexed/parsed according to the provided rules should raise an InvalidInputException. We recommend using relevant error messages when raising these exceptions, to make debugging easier. We are not requiring intelligent messages that pinpoint an error to help a programmer debug, but as you do this project you might find you see where you could add those.

All tests will be run on direct calls to your code, comparing your return values to the expected return values. Any other output (e.g., for your own debugging) will be ignored. You are free and encouraged to have additional output.

Here is an example SmallC program:

int x;
x = 2 * 3 ^ 5 + 4;
printf(x > 100);
An example use of the parser in Utop:

parse_stmt (tokenize "int x; x = 2 * 3 ^ 5 + 4; printf(x > 100);")
Ground Rules
In your code, you may use any non-imperative OCaml modules and features we have taught in this class (If you come asking for help using something we have not taught we will direct you to use methods taught in this class). Imperative Ocaml is not allowed.

Testing
You can run your lexer or parser directly on a SmallC program by running dune exec bin/interface.bc lex [filename] or dune exec bin/interface.bc parse [filename] where the [filename] argument is required.

You can run the tests as usual with dune runtest -f. To test from the toplevel, run dune utop src. The necessary functions and types will automatically be imported for you.

All of our tests will feed C code into your program to be lexed and parsed. You can write your own tests which only test the parser by feeding it a custom token list. For example, to see how the expression 1 + 2 ^ 3 * 4 would be parsed, you can construct the token list manually (e.g. in Utop):

parse_expr [Tok_Int 1; Tok_Add; Tok_Int 3; Tok_Pow; Tok_Int 3; Tok_Mult; Tok_Int 4; EOF];;
This way, you can work on the parser even if your lexer is not complete yet.

Submitting
You will submit this project to Gradescope. Make sure to submit BOTH parser.ml and lexer.ml each time, even if you only modified one of them.

Part 1: The Lexer (aka Scanner or Tokenizer)
Before your parser can process input, the raw file must be transformed into logical units called tokens. The goal is to transform a SmallC program, represented as a string, into a list of tokens that capture the different elements of the program. This process is readily handled by use of regular expressions. Information about OCaml's regular expressions library can be found in the Str module documentation. You aren't required to use it, but you may find it very helpful. Note that a lexer is the same as a scanner, which is discussed in the lecture slides.

Your lexer must be written in lexer.ml. You will need to implement the following function:

tokenize
Type: string -> token list

Description: Converts SmallC source code (given as a string) to the associated token list.

Examples:

tokenize "1 + 2" = [Tok_Int 1; Tok_Add; Tok_Int 2; EOF]
tokenize "" = [EOF]
tokenize "int main() { int x; }" = [Tok_Int_Type; Tok_Main; Tok_LParen; Tok_RParen; Tok_LBrace; Tok_Int_Type; Tok_ID "x"; Tok_Semi; Tok_RBrace; EOF]
The token type is implemented in tokenTypes.ml.

A few important notes to consider:

Tokens can be separated by arbitrary amounts of whitespace, which your lexer should discard. Spaces, tabs ('\t') and newlines ('\n') are all considered whitespace.
The lexer should be case sensitive.
Lexer output should be terminated by the EOF token, meaning that the shortest possible output from the lexer is [EOF].
If the beginning of a string could be multiple things, the longest match should be preferred, for example:
"while0" should not be lexed as Tok_While, but as Tok_ID("while0"), since it is an identifier
"1-1" should be lexed as Tok_Int(1) and Tok_Int(-1), since "-1" is a valid integer.
Most tokens only exist in one form (for example, the only way for Tok_Pow to appear in the program is as ^ and the only way for Tok_While to appear in the program is as while). However, a few tokens have more complex rules. The regular expressions for these more complex rules are provided here:

Tok_Bool of bool: The value will be set to true on the input string "true" and false on the input string "false".
Regular Expression: true|false
Tok_Int of int: Valid ints may be positive or negative and consist of 1 or more digits. You may find the function int_of_string useful in lexing this token type.
Regular Expression: -?[0-9]+
Tok_ID of string: Valid IDs must start with a letter and can be followed by any number of letters or numbers. Note that keywords may be contained within IDs and they should be counted as IDs unless they perfectly match a keyword!
Regular Expression: [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*
Valid examples:
"a"
"ABC"
"a1b2c3DEF6"
"while1"
"ifelsewhile"
In grammars given later in this project description, we use the lexical representation of tokens instead of the token name; e.g. we write ( instead of Tok_LParen. This table shows all mappings of tokens to their lexical representations, excluding the three literal token types specified above:

Token Name (in OCaml)	Lexical Representation (in grammars below)
Tok_LParen	(
Tok_RParen	)
Tok_LBrace	{
Tok_RBrace	}
Tok_Equal	==
Tok_NotEqual	!=
Tok_Assign	=
Tok_Greater	>
Tok_Less	<
Tok_GreaterEqual	>=
Tok_LessEqual	<=
Tok_Or	||
Tok_And	&&
Tok_Not	!
Tok_Semi	;
Tok_Int_Type	int
Tok_Bool_Type	bool
Tok_Print	printf
Tok_Main	main
Tok_If	if
Tok_Else	else
Tok_For	for
Tok_From	from
Tok_To	to
Tok_While	while
Tok_Add	+
Tok_Sub	-
Tok_Mult	*
Tok_Div	/
Tok_Pow	^
Your lexing code will feed the tokens into your parser, so a broken lexer can cause you to fail tests related to parsing.

Part 2: The Parser
Once the program has been transformed from a string of raw characters into more manageable tokens, you're ready to parse. The parser consists of three main functions which parse expressions, statements, and an entire program (parse_expr, parse_stmt and parse_main). The three work together to parse a full program.

Each takes a stream of tokens and outputs an OCaml variant type representing an AST for the input. In the case of parse_expr, the root is type expr; for parse_stmt, type stmt; and parse_main, type stmt again (since the main function in SmallC just holds a list of statements). You can and should write parse_expr and parse_stmt in that order, to test them, in utop, on small fragments of SmallC, but the parser is ultimately initiated by a call to parse_main.

The three functions are specified below:

parse_expr
Type: token list -> token list * expr
Description: Takes a list of tokens and returns an AST representing the expression corresponding to the given tokens, along with the new, reduced list of tokens
Exceptions: If the next tokens in the token list do not represent an expression, raise InvalidInputException.
Examples:
parse_expr [Tok_Int(1); Tok_Add; Tok_Int(2); Tok_Semi; EOF] = ([Tok_Semi; EOF], Add (Int 1, Int 2))
parse_expr [Tok_Int(1); EOF] = ([EOF], Int 1)
parse_expr [Tok_Int_Type; EOF] (* InvalidInputException *)
parse_stmt
Type: token list -> token list * stmt
Description: Takes a list of tokens and returns an AST representing the statement corresponding to the given tokens, along with the new, reduced list of tokens
Exceptions: If the next tokens in the token list do not represent a statement, raise InvalidInputException.
Examples:
parse_stmt [Tok_Int_Type; Tok_ID("x"); Tok_Semi; EOF] = ([EOF], Seq (Declare (Int_Type, "x"), NoOp))
parse_stmt [Tok_ID("x"); Tok_Assign; Tok_Int(3); Tok_Semi; EOF] = ([EOF], Seq (Assign ("x", Int 3), NoOp))
parse_stmt [Tok_Int(3); Tok_Add; Tok_Int(4); EOF] (* InvalidInputException *)
parse_main
Type: token list -> stmt
Description: Takes a list of tokens and returns an AST representing the list of statements in the body of the main function. All tokens should be consumed, so there is no need to return the remaining tokens.
Exceptions: If the list of tokens does not contain only EOF at the end, raise InvalidInputException. Also, if the token list contains tokens before the beginning of the main function declaration, or after it's last closing brace, or if the main function doesn't exist in the token list, raie InvalidInputException.
Examples:
parse_main [Tok_Int_Type; Tok_Main; Tok_LParen; Tok_RParen; Tok_LBrace; Tok_Int_Type; Tok_ID("x"); Tok_Semi; Tok_RBrace; EOF] = Seq (Declare (Int_Type, "x"), NoOp)
parse_main [Tok_Int(3); Tok_Add; Tok_Int(4); EOF] (* InvalidInputException *)
The parser must be implemented in parser.ml in accordance with the signatures found in parser.mli. parser.ml is the only file you will write code in. The functions should be left in the order they are provided, as a good implementation will rely heavily on earlier functions.

Note: we have provided the function match_token which takes the list of tokens and a single token as arguments, and will either:

Return a new token list with the first token removed IF the first token matches the second argument, or
Raise an exception IF the first token does not match the second argument to the function.
We have also provided the lookahead function which returns the first token in the list of tokens, but does NOT modify the token list. This function will raise an exception if the token list is empty.

We provide a CFG below for the language of C expressions. This CFG is right-recursive, so something like 1 + 2 + 3 will parse as Add (Int 1, Add (Int 2, Int 3)), essentially implying parentheses in the form (1 + (2 + 3))). As convention, in the given CFG all non-terminals are capitalized, all syntax literals (terminals) are formatted as non-italicized code and will come in to the parser as tokens from your lexer. Variant token types (i.e. Tok_Bool, Tok_Int, and Tok_ID) will be printed as italicized code.

parse_expr
Expressions represent mathematical and boolean formulas that typically evaluate to either an integer or a boolean. Because expressions are a self-contained subset of the SmallC grammar, we can implement them first, and build the rest of the language on top of them later.

type expr =
  | ID of string
  | Int of int
  | Bool of bool
  | Add of expr * expr
  | Sub of expr * expr
  | Mult of expr * expr
  | Div of expr * expr
  | Pow of  expr * expr
  | Greater of expr * expr
  | Less of expr * expr
  | GreaterEqual of expr * expr
  | LessEqual of expr * expr
  | Equal of expr * expr
  | NotEqual of expr * expr
  | Or of expr * expr
  | And of expr * expr
  | Not of expr
The CFG of expressions, from which you should produce a value of expr AST type, is as follows:

Expr -> OrExpr
OrExpr -> AndExpr || OrExpr | AndExpr
AndExpr -> EqualityExpr && AndExpr | EqualityExpr
EqualityExpr -> RelationalExpr EqualityOperator EqualityExpr | RelationalExpr
EqualityOperator -> == | !=
RelationalExpr -> AdditiveExpr RelationalOperator RelationalExpr | AdditiveExpr
RelationalOperator -> < | > | <= | >=
AdditiveExpr -> MultiplicativeExpr AdditiveOperator AdditiveExpr | MultiplicativeExpr
AdditiveOperator -> + | -
MultiplicativeExpr -> PowerExpr MultiplicativeOperator MultiplicativeExpr | PowerExpr
MultiplicativeOperator -> * | /
PowerExpr -> UnaryExpr ^ PowerExpr | UnaryExpr
UnaryExpr -> ! UnaryExpr | PrimaryExpr
PrimaryExpr -> Tok_Int | Tok_Bool | Tok_ID | ( Expr )
For more information on how we constructed this CFG, see [ambiguity.md][ambiguity.md]. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with this process.

As an example, see how the parser will break down an input mixing a few different operators with different precedence:

Input:

2 * 3 ^ 5 + 4
Output (after lexing and parsing):

Add(
  Mult(
    Int(2),
    Pow(
      Int(3),
      Int(5))),
  Int(4))
parse_stmt
The next step to parsing is to build statements up around your expression parser. When parsing, a sequence of statements should be terminated as a NoOp, which you will remember as a do-nothing instruction from the interpreter. Recall the stmt type:

type stmt =
  | NoOp
  | Seq of stmt * stmt
  | Declare of data_type * string
  | Assign of string * expr
  | If of expr * stmt * stmt
  | For of string * expr * expr * stmt
  | While of expr * stmt
  | Print of expr
The stmt type isn't self-contained like the expr type, and instead refers both to itself and to expr; use your parse_expr function to avoid duplicate code! Again, we provide a CFG for you to refer to when building your parser:

Stmt -> StmtOptions Stmt | StmtOptions
StmtOptions -> DeclareStmt | AssignStmt | PrintStmt | IfStmt | ForStmt | WhileStmt
DeclareStmt -> BasicType ID ;
BasicType -> int | bool
AssignStmt -> ID = Expr ;
PrintStmt -> printf ( Expr ) ;
IfStmt -> if ( Expr ) { Stmt } ElseBranch
ElseBranch -> else { Stmt } | ε
ForStmt -> for ( ID from Expr to Expr ) { Stmt }
WhileStmt -> while ( Expr ) { Stmt }
As with the expression grammar, the process we used to enable the grammar to be parsable can be found in ambiguity.md.

If we expand on our previous example, we can see how the expression parser integrates directly into the statement parser:

Input:

int x;
x = 2 * 3 ^ 5 + 4;
printf(x > 100);
Output (after lexing and parsing):

Seq(Declare(Int_Type, "x"),
Seq(Assign("x",
  Add(
    Mult(
      Int 2,
      Pow(
        Int 3,
        Int 5)),
    Int 4)),
Seq(Print(Greater(ID "x", Int 100)), NoOp)))
Input:

int main(){
  int a;
  for (a from 1 to 10){
    printf(a);
  }
}
Output:

(Seq
  (Declare (Int_Type, "a"),
   Seq (For ("a", Int 1, Int 10, Seq (Print (ID "a"), NoOp)),
        NoOp)))
parse_main
The last and shortest step is to have your parser handle the function entry point. This is where parse_main : token list -> stmt comes in. This function behaves the exact same way as parse_stmt, except for two key semantic details:

parse_main will parse the function declaration for main, not just the body.
parse_main validates that a successful parse terminates in EOF. A parse not ending in EOF should raise an InvalidInputException in parse_main. As such, parse_main does NOT return remaining tokens, since it validates ensures that the token list is emptied by the parse.
The grammar for this parse is provided here:

Main -> int main ( ) { Stmt } EOF
For this slightly modified input to the example used in the previous two sections, the exact same output would be produced:

Input:

int main() {
  int x;
  x = 2 * 3 ^ 5 + 4;
  printf(x > 100);
}
The output is the exact same as in the statement parser, but parse_main also trims off the function header and verifies that all tokens are consumed.

Academic Integrity
Please carefully read the academic honesty section of the course syllabus. Any evidence of impermissible cooperation on projects, use of disallowed materials or resources, or unauthorized use of computer accounts, will be submitted to the Student Honor Council, which could result in an XF for the course, or suspension or expulsion from the University. Be sure you understand what you are and what you are not permitted to do in regards to academic integrity when it comes to project assignments. These policies apply to all students, and the Student Honor Council does not consider lack of knowledge of the policies to be a defense for violating them. Full information is found in the course syllabus, which you should review before starting.




The Evaluator
The evaluator must be implemented in eval.ml in accordance with the signatures for eval_expr and eval_stmt found in eval.mli. eval.ml is the only file you will write code in. The functions should be left in the order they are provided, as your implementation of eval_stmt will rely on eval_expr.

The heart of SmallC is your evaluator. We have already implemented Lexer and Parser modules that deal with constructing tokens and creating the AST out of a program. Where your code picks up is with a representation of SmallC programs as OCaml datatypes, which you are then responsible for evaluating according the rules below. A program is made up of a series of statements and expressions:

Statements represent the structure of a program - declarations, assignments, control flow, and prints in the case of SmallC.
Expressions represent operations on data - variable lookups, mathematical and boolean operations, and comparison. Expressions can't affect the environment, and as a result only return a value containing the value of the expression.
You are responsible for implementing two functions, eval_expr and eval_stmt in that order. Each of these takes as an argument an environment (given in smallCTypes.ml) that is an association list. An association list is a list of pairs (2-tuples) where the key is the first element of the pair and the value is the second element. Elements earlier in the list override elements later in the list. In our case the association list is of type (string * value) list where the string is the id name and the value is the current value of that id. The List module has many useful functions for working with association lists. Statements may change the values of variables, so eval_stmt returns a possibly updated environment.

A formal operational semantics of SmallC can be found in semantics.pdf. We highly recommend you read this document as you work to clear up any possible ambiguity introduced by the English explanations below. The formal semantics do not, however, define error cases such as addition between a boolean and an integer and therefore represent a stuck reduction. The expected behavior for these irreducible error cases are defined only in this document and can be boiled down to the following rules:

Any expression containing division by zero should raise a DivByZero error when evaluated.
Any expression or statement that is applied to the wrong types should raise a TypeError exception when evaluated, for example, the expression 1 + true would result in TypeError.
An expression or statement that redefines an already defined variable, assigns to an undefined variable, or reads from an undefined variable should raise a DeclareError when evaluated.
We do not enforce what messages you use when raising the TypeError or DeclareError exceptions; that's up to you. Evaluation of subexpressions should be done from left to right, as specified by the semantics, in order to ensure that lines with multiple possible errors match up with our expected errors.

Part 1: eval_expr
Type: environment -> expr -> value
Description: Takes an environment env and an expression e and produces the result of evaluating e, which is something of type value (Int_Val or Bool_Val).
Int
Integer literals evaluate to a Int_Val of the same value.

Bool
Boolean literals evaluate to a Bool_Val of the same value.

ID
An identifier evaluates to whatever value it is mapped to by the environment. Should raise a DeclareError if the identifier has no binding.

Add, Sub, Mult, Div, and Pow
These rules are jointly classified as BinOp-Int in the formal semantics.

These mathematical operations operate only on integers and produce a Int_Val containing the result of the operation. All operators must work for all possible integer values, positive or negative, except for division, which will raise a DivByZeroError exception on an attempt to divide by zero. If either argument to one of these operators evaluates to a non-integer, a TypeError should be raised. For exponentiation, if the operation would give you back a non-integer, you should floor it.

Or and And
These rules are jointly classified as BinOp-Bool in the formal semantics.

These logical operations operate only on booleans and produce a Bool_Val containing the result of the operation. If either argument to one of these operators evaluates to a non-boolean, a TypeError should be raised.

Not
The unary not operator operates only on booleans and produces a Bool_Val containing the negated value of the contained expression. If the expression in the Not is not a boolean (and does not evaluate to a boolean), a TypeError should be raised.

Greater, Less, GreaterEqual, LessEqual
These rules are jointly classified as BinOp-Int in the formal semantics

These relational operators operate only on integers and produce a Bool_Val containing the result of the operation. If either argument to one of these operators evaluates to a non-integer, a TypeError should be raised.

Equal and NotEqual
These equality operators operate both on integers and booleans, but both subexpressions must be of the same type. The operators produce a Bool_Val containing the result of the operation. If the two arguments to these operators do not evaluate to the same type (i.e. one boolean and one integer), a TypeError should be raised.

Part 2: eval_stmt
Type: environment -> stmt -> environment
Description: Takes an environment env and a statement s and produces an updated environment (defined in smallCTypes.ml) as a result. This environment is represented as a in the formal semantics, but will be referred to as the environment in this document.
NoOp
NoOp is short for "no operation" and should do just that - nothing at all. It is used to terminate a chain of sequence statements, and is much like the empty list in OCaml in that way. The environment should be returned unchanged when evaluating a NoOp.

Seq
The sequencing statement is used to compose whole programs as a series of statements. When evaluating Seq, evaluate the first substatement under the environment env to create an updated environment env'. Then, evaluate the second substatement under env', returning the resulting environment.

Declare
The declaration statement is used to create new variables in the environment. If a variable of the same name has already been declared, a DeclareError should be raised. Otherwise, if the type being declared is Int_Type, a new binding to the value Int_Val(0) should be made in the environment. If the type being declared is Bool_Type, a new binding to the value Bool_Val(false) should be made in the environment. The updated environment should be returned.

Assign
The assignment statement assigns new values to already-declared variables. If the variable hasn't been declared before assignment, a DeclareError should be raised. If the variable has been declared to a different type than the one being assigned into it, a TypeError should be raised. Otherwise, the environment should be updated to reflect the new value of the given variable, and an updated environment should be returned.

If
The if statement consists of three components - a guard expression, an if-body statement and an else-body statement. The guard expression must evaluate to a boolean - if it does not, a TypeError should be raised. If it evaluates to true, the if-body should be evaluated. Otherwise, the else-body should be evaluated instead. The environment resulting from evaluating the correct body should be returned.

While
The while statement consists of two components - a guard expression and a body statement. The guard expression must evaluate to a boolean - if it does not, a TypeError should be raised. If it evaluates to true, the body should be evaluated to produce a new environment and the entire loop should then be evaluated again under this new environment, returning the environment produced by the reevaluation. If the guard evaluates to false, the current environment should simply be returned.

The formal semantics rule for while loops is particularly helpful!

For
The for statement will contain four components: an ID, a starting expression, an ending expression, and a body statement. The starting and ending expressions should both evaluate to an integer value that will be used as the start value for your ID, and the ending point of the loop respectively (inclusive). If either of the expressions do not evaluate to an integer, then you should raise a TypeError.

On each iteration of the for loop you should evaluate the body statement. This evaluation will result in a new environment, under which the following iteration of the loop will be evaluated. Note that the for loop for our language is self-incrementing, meaning that the ID will be incremented by one at the end of the loop (with any other changes made to the ID or other variables from within the body being respected). The current environment will be returned in the case that the value is not within the range as defined by the starting and ending expressions.

Print
The print statement is your project's access to standard output. First, the expression to print should be evaluated. Print supports both integers and booleans. Integers should print in their natural forms (i.e. printing Int_Val(10) should print "10". Booleans should print in plaintext (i.e. printing Bool_Val(true) should print "true" and likewise for "false"). Whatever is printed should always be followed by a newline.

VERY IMPORTANT NOTE ON PRINTING: If you attempt to print with print_string, print_int, etc... you will fail any test that checks your output. This is because we do not directly intercept your output, but rather have implemented some wrapper functions in the Utils for program printing (do not remove open Utils from the top of eval.ml!). As a result, your code may have any amount of print_string statements and it WILL NOT affect the tests. Only printing performed through the following wrapper functions will be evaluated by the test system, and as a result should be used exclusively with Print. The supplied print wrappers which you must use in place of the built-in print functions for any and all output resulting from Print statements and for nothing else are as follows:

print_output_string : string -> unit
print_output_int : int -> unit
print_output_bool : bool -> unit
print_output_newline : unit -> unit
Again, you may use the normal prints defined in the standard library Stdlib module, but they will not affect your test grading in any way.
